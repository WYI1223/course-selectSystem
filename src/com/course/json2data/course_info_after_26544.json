The emphasis will be on the algorithms and their implementations including supervised learning, statistical learning, neural network and support vector machine. We will also look into more advanced topics such as domain reduction and clustering and deep reinforcement learning. Besides existing algorithms, we will also study how to create new algorithms based on advanced analytical results.  ", "comments": "WENZHOU-KEAN STUDENTS ONLY."}
